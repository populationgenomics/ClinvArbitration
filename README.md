# CPG Python Template

Template repository based on the [CPG team-docs](https://github.com/populationgenomics/team-docs/blob/main/new_repository.md) content.

This contains python and markdown linting configuration, and a github linting action.
Before making a new repository based on this template, it may be worth auditing the versions of linting tools and GitHub Actions listed in _.pre-commit-config.yaml_ and _.github/workflows_.
